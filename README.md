# <Horiseon Refactor Project>

## Description

The code for the Horiseon website was refactored to meet accessibility standards. HTML elements were relabeled in a semantic manner and to follow a logical structure, alt attribute text was added to images, heading attributes now fall in sequential order, and the title is now concise and descriptive. In addition, the HTML and CSS code were tidied up and comments were added during this refactoring.

By modifying the code, it becomes more accessible and optimizes the page for search engines.

## User Story
